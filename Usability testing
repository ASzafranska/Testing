What are usability tests?
    They are among qualitative research methods that allow us to assess how intuitive a website is for a target audience.
	
Usability consists of ease of:
    - learning
    - memorability
    - performance
    - overall satisfaction
    - errors
	
Usability testing objectives:
    - to identify weaknesses in the offering
    - observation of how quickly users perform particular actions
    - analyzing what customers click on most often
    - checking which pages most often cause exit from the site
    - testing solutions implemented by competitors
	
The ideal number of test users and time?
There is a theory by Jakob Nielsen, that claims that 5 respondents are enough to discover about 85% of problems in the system. Running the test a second or third time will allow you to find that the problems that occur are duplicated. Therefore, in one iteration, five respondents and an hour of time together with follow-up questions should be enough to uncover most bugs.

Usability tests can be divided into three main types:
    - moderated remote usability tests
    - unmoderated remote usability tests
    - desktop moderated user tests

And what aren't usability tests?
    - A/B tests
    - Surveys
    - Heat maps
    - Acceptance tests
